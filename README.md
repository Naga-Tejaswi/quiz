The Interactive Quiz App is a lightweight, browser-based application built entirely using foundational web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—with no external libraries or frameworks. Designed for beginners as well as intermediate developers looking to solidify their front-end skills, this project showcases fundamental principles like DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic content rendering, and user interaction feedback. The app presents a series of multiple-choice questions related to programming and web development. It evaluates user input in real time, tracks the score, and ultimately delivers a summary of the performance upon completion of the quiz.Structurally, the HTML file (index.html) defines the overall layout and organizes the app’s UI elements into a cohesive interface. At the top of the page is a simple <h1> tag with the title "Quiz", followed by a container that houses the quiz box. Within this, there's a <p> element designated for the question text, a <div> for dynamic answer options, a “Next” button that remains hidden until a question is answered, and a <p> tag reserved for displaying the final score once the quiz concludes. The file also includes basic metadata to set character encoding and ensure responsiveness across devices. External assets like a CSS stylesheet and a JavaScript file are linked in the head and footer respectively, ensuring proper separation of concerns and maintainability.The style.css file brings a visually appealing user interface to life. The page background is set to a rich blue-violet tone, giving the app a vibrant and modern feel. Flexbox is used on the <body> to center the quiz container both vertically and horizontally on the screen, ensuring that the app is both visually balanced and responsive. Inside the .quiz-container, clean design choices like padding, rounded corners, and subtle drop shadows give the UI a polished look. Specific classes are styled for questions, options, buttons, and scores, with hover effects on the .option elements that enhance user interactivity. The "Next" button is given a standout red shade, ensuring it's easily noticeable when it appears after a question is answered.Functionally, the script.js file powers all the interactivity of the quiz app. It begins by defining an array of question objects, where each object contains a question string, an array  of four answer options, and the correct answer string. The app initializes with two variables: currentQuestion, which tracks the index of the current question, and score, which keeps a running tally of correct answers. Core DOM elements are referenced using document.getElementById to dynamically update content and respond to user actions.The loadQuestion() function populates the quiz area with the current question and its respective options. It clears previous options before displaying new ones to prevent overlap or duplication. Each answer option is created as a clickable <div> with a class of option, and each is equipped with an onclick handler that triggers the checkAnswer() function. Upon selection, the app evaluates the chosen answer against the correct one stored in the question object. A simple alert() is used to provide instant feedback—either acknowledging a correct response or indicating the right answer in case of an incorrect one. After any selection, the “Next” button becomes visible, allowing the user to proceed to the following question.Clicking the “Next” button increments the currentQuestion index and reloads the next question using the same mechanism, hiding the button until another answer is chosen. Once the user has completed all the questions, the app calls the showScore() function, which updates the interface to display a final message of “Quiz Completed!” and the user's total score out of the total number of questions. The options area and next button are both cleared to signify the end of the session.Altogether, this project serves as a practical and hands-on example of how to create an engaging user experience with pure front-end code. It reinforces concepts like modular code organization, clean UI design, user feedback loops, and responsive behavior. Moreover, its simplicity makes it highly extensible—developers can easily add features such as question randomization, scoring animations, or local storage integration to record high scores. Ideal for portfolios, workshops, coding bootcamps, or just fun personal challenges, the Interactive Quiz App demonstrates that effective web applications don’t require complex stacks—just solid understanding of the fundamentals.
